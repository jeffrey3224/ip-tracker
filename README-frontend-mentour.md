## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### My Process 

My workflow begins with building out the core functionality to ensure everything works as intended. Once the foundation is solid, I focus on styling—creating a visually appealing, responsive design that enhances the overall user experience.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project gave me valuable experience working with multiple APIs and handling their data effectively. I learned how to parse and structure the responses in a way that is both functional and flexible, making the application scalable for future features and improvements.


### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to deepen my understanding of APIs and explore the many ways data can be transmitted, processed, and transformed into meaningful, usable outputs. I’m especially interested in learning best practices for building reliable, efficient, and adaptable API integrations.
